PROJECT 1 
Secure User Authentication 

Implement a user authentication system with secure login and registration functionality. Users should be able to sign up for an
account, log in securely, and access protected routes only after successful authentication. 

Optional: Use standard mechanisms to handle password hashing, session management, and user role-based access control. 

To implement secure user authentication with password hashing, session management, and user role-based access control, you can use the Flask framework with additional tools like Flask-Login and SQLAlchemy.

Here is a complete, step-by-step implementation:

Tech Stack
Flask: Web framework.
Flask-SQLAlchemy: ORM for database interaction.
Flask-Login: User session management.
Bcrypt: Secure password hashing.
SQLite: Lightweight database for storing user information.
